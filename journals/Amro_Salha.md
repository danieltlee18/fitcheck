03/27/23 | Today marked the beginning of our collaborative coding endeavor. Our primary focus was to develop the necessary APIs and establish routes for outfit listing and creation.

03/28/23 | The team dedicated today to backend authentication. Despite encountering some challenges in adapting MongoDB materials to PostgreSQL, we made significant progress. However, the authentication process remained incomplete.

03/29/23 | After overcoming several issues, we managed to achieve seemingly functional authentication. Our accomplishments included successful account creation, login, and logout functionalities. Additionally, we ensured that only logged-in users could create outfits. Tomorrow, we plan to finalize the code for enabling users to rate outfits. I (Amro) began to work on front-end to match with the back-end functionalities.

03/30/23 | Today, we successfully completed the code for creating ratings and associated them with the respective users. We implemented an if statement to ensure that users could only provide ratings based on predetermined options. Our next objective is to display the ratings for each outfit within the list outfit function. I (Amro) worked more on the front-end in tandem with the back-end functionalities being devloped.

04/03/23 | As a team, we collaborated on displaying ratings alongside their respective IDs and values when listing all outfits. This implementation was successful. Furthermore, we focused on refactoring the routers' code into their respective repositories to enhance the RESTfulness of the endpoints.

04/04/23 | Today, we finalized the front-end login page, ensuring its seamless integration with our existing design. We invested time in experimenting with various CSS stylings to achieve the desired appearance and functionality.

04/05/23 | Our efforts were dedicated to setting up Redux to facilitate the implementation of front-end signup and login functionalities. The necessary code has been put in place, and we anticipate connecting it to our login and signup JSX components.

04/06/23 | We are pleased to announce the completion of the front-end signup and login functionalities. Users can now create an account, which will redirect them to the website's dashboard upon successful registration. Similarly, logging in will also redirect users to the dashboard. The remaining task involves implementing the logout functionality, thereby finalizing the authentication process.

04/07/23 | Today, we successfully implemented the logout functionality within our application. Additionally, we began working on creating the page that allows users to upload their outfits.

04/17/23 | Our team accomplished the functionality for the "create an outfit" page and commenced working on the "list outfits" page. To ensure a personalized experience, we need to implement a filter that displays only the outfits created by the current user. We expect to complete this task tomorrow.

04/18/23 | We successfully added the necessary filter to the "list outfits" page, which now exclusively displays the current user's outfits. Substantial progress was made on the "rating" page, with only the addition of a filter remaining to showcase outfits that do not belong to the user. Tomorrow, we aim to finalize these tasks, along with implementing the functionality to display the user's top three outfits on the dashboard.

04/19/23 | Today, we made notable progress by implementing the functionality to display outfits of other users when rating. Furthermore, we refactored the code for outfit rating to optimize its efficiency.

04/20/23 | We achieved multiple milestones today. Firstly, we successfully implemented the functionality to showcase the user's top three outfits on the dashboard. Additionally, we enhanced the context provided for rating other users' outfits. Moreover, we incorporated scrolling functionality into the list of personal outfits, complemented by a customized scrollbar.

04/24/23 | Today, our team devoted time to refining the visual appeal of the website by conducting CSS clean-up. We also added links to the "my outfits" and "dashboard" pages, which will be displayed if the user has not uploaded any outfits.

04/25/23 | On the current day, our team dedicated our efforts to exploring and gaining a deeper understanding of unit testing. We focused on the functionality of unit tests and made significant progress. Specifically, we successfully implemented a unit test that ensures the retrieval of a user's account is functioning correctly.

04/26/23 | We concluded the process of writing tests and successfully finalized the implementation of the delete functionality, incorporating tags into the process.

04/27/23 | We finished the documentation and README, performed code cleanup, and addressed some CSS bugs. However, we recognize the importance of conducting one final round of code cleanliness to ensure optimal quality and organization.
