03/27/23 | Started coding in a group today. Started working on the APIs we needed to flesh out and made routes for listing and creating outfits. Will begin working on authentication tomorrow.

03/28/23 | Started working on backend authentication today. We were not able to finish it today but we made good progress. We had to adapt the materials from MongoDB to PostgreSQL for auth, and things weren't working the way I expected.

03/29/23 | After a good bit of issues, we ended up getting authentication to seemingly function properly. We were able to create an account, login, and logout. We were also able to get authentication to work with creating an outfit so that only logged in users can create outfits. Tomorrow we should be able to finish the code allowing for users to create a rating for an outfit.

03/30/23 | We were able to finish the create rating code and we created ratings with the user attached to it. We added an if statement to ensure that the user could only give ratings that we previously agreed on. The next thing we need to do is get the ratings for an outfit to show in the list outfit function.

04/03/23 | We all coded together again today and worked on getting the ratings to show up with their respective IDs and values when listing all outfits. We were able to successfully implement that and then worked on refactoring code from the routers into their respective repos, and made endpoints more RESTful.
